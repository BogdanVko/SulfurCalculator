The original production site files should first be
backed up!

The files sulfurcalc.cfm and sulfurcalc1.cfm 
reference a new folder named include_2020
which should be copied into the production site before
the above files are copied.

Then the sulfurcalc.cfm and sulfurcalc1.cfm files
should be copied to cvmwebprod03.
